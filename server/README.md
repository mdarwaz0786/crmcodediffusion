# CRM Web Application

This is a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).

## Notable Changes

- Some table and input field names in the UI differ from those used in the backend, but they represent the same data.

## Database Table Mappings

- **Team Table**: Represents the `Employee` data.
- **Customer Table**: Represents the `Client` data.
- **Invoice Table**: Represents the `Tax Invoice` data.

## Field Name Mappings in Project Table

- `projectPrice`: Represents the `Project Cost`.
- `totalPaid`: Represents the `Total Received`.
- `description`: Represents the `Development Phase Description`.
